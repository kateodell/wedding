                  We will have a short outdoor ceremony at 4pm followed by drinks, dinner, and dancing into the evening. Most of the festivities will be outdoors on grass, so please wear comfortable shoes. You may want to bring a light sweater or jacket for later in the evening.

                <h4>Transportation</h4>
                <p>
                There will be a free shuttle running between the Bear Paw Lodge and the Pepper Tree Inn throughout the evening, which we encourage all our guests to use. If you drive to the lodge yourself, you will need to park in the high school parking lot across the street.
